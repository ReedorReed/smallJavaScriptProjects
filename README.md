# smallJavaScriptProjects

## A collection of small projects for practicing JS.

The projects will be mostly very small practice projects. However there will also be some bigger projects, ToDo app sized but not bigger than that.

Maybe I will upload them to a dedicated page on my website. Only the future will tell.

Som of the projects will be these ChatGPT helped me find:

- **Alert Message Button**
  - Create a button that, when clicked, shows an alert using alert("Hello!").
- **Change Text on Click**
  - Have a button that changes a paragraph's text when clicked. Use document.getElementById("myText").innerText = "New text!";
- **Show/Hide Password**
  - Add a checkbox to toggle between showing and hiding a password input field. Change input.type between "password" and "text".
- **Background Color Changer**
  - Clicking a button changes the background to a different color. Use document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
- **Simple Counter**
  - A button increases or decreases a number when clicked. Use let count = 0; and innerText to update it.
- **Display Current Date & Time**
  - Show the current date and time when clicking a button. Use new Date().toLocaleString().
- **Text Size Changer**
  - Buttons increase and decrease font size of a paragraph. Use style.fontSize = "20px";.
